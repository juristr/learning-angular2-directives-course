## IMPORTANT course update

I have **updated and published this video course** to the latest changes after the final release of Angular 2 in a new edition: ["Learning Angular components (2nd edition)"](https://goo.gl/zrGX8K).

You can buy the course on the [official PacktPub site](https://goo.gl/zrGX8K). If you decide to stick with this course, it's totally fine, but I'd recommend looking at the new, updated source code which can be found here: https://github.com/juristr/learning-angular-components-course :smiley:.
